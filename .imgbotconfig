# Compress Wiki

If your repository has a wiki with images, you can opt in to optimize these images as well as your code repo.

By adding `compressWiki` in the `.imgbotconfig` file as displayed below, you will enable this feature.

```
{
    "schedule": "daily", // daily|weekly|monthly
    "ignoredFiles": [
        "*.jpg",                   // ignore by extension
        "image1.png",              // ignore by filename
        "public/special_images/*", // ignore by folderpath
    ],
    "aggressiveCompression": "true" // true|false
    "compressWiki": "true" // true|false
}
```
